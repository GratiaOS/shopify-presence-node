# Shopify Presence Node — Merchant Guide (v1.0)

Welcome to the **Garden Presence Node** for Shopify.  
This guide explains what the Presence Node does, how it helps your store, and how to configure it in a few minutes.

---

## 🌱 What Is the Presence Node?

The Presence Node is your store’s **AI-powered brand voice** — a helper that responds consistently to customers, generates content for you, and keeps your communications aligned with your identity.

It is not a chatbot.  
It is not an automation script.  
It is a **brand personality layer** that runs inside Shopify Admin.

---

## 🧩 How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **You define your brand identity**  
   Tone, rituals, glossary terms, policies, limits.

2. **Presence Node uses that identity**  
   When answering customers or helping you draft announcements.

3. **Pattern Engine generates the response**  
   (AI + guardrails, always filtered through your identity config)

4. **You approve or edit**  
   Nothing is posted automatically unless you choose to.

## 🎛️ Configure Your Brand Identity

Inside the app, you’ll find:

- **Tone** — friendly, formal, concise, warm, etc.
- **Rituals** — greeting, closing, fallback responses.
- **Glossary** — your product names, nicknames, internal language.
- **Policies** — shipping, refunds, support hours.
- **Limits** — topics the AI should avoid (e.g., legal, medical, promises).

This identity is what the Presence Node uses in every reply.

## 💬 Modes

The Presence Node supports two modes:

### **1. Support Mode (customer-facing)**

Used for:

- answering customer questions
- clarifying policies
- giving accurate shipping info
- helping reduce support load

Support Mode is brand-safe, polite, and avoids over-promising.

---

### **2. Merchant–Codex Mode (merchant-facing)**

Used for:

- writing product announcements
- generating email copy
- planning a campaign
- rewriting content in your brand voice

This mode is direct, efficient, and built for productivity.

---

## 🧪 Test It

Inside the Admin UI:

- Configure your identity
- Test Support Mode with a real question
- Test Merchant–Codex Mode with a prompt like:

  _“Write a friendly weekend sale announcement for the Aurora Hoodie.”_

You’ll immediately see the full pipeline working.
